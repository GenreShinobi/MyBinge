## MYBINGE
This project was started in July of 2020 as part of "9 Projects you can do to become a Frontend Master in 2020".

The original ask: 
- [x] Use React with Hooks
- [x] Create the App with create-react-app
- [x] Use JSX to build the HTML for the site
- [x] Use CSS to style the site

Being an over achiever I stepped up the ask: 
- [x] Allow the user to add movies to their Binge List
- [x] Use authentication so that the site recognizes the user, and serve them their bing list 
- [x] Use some advanced CSS techniques like transitions and gradients

The project was "completed" in roughly 4 days. But it's not over. There's still some tweaks I'd like to make when I come back to it. 
- [ ] Rename "My Folio" the "My Binge List" 
- [ ] Allow a user to remove a movie from their Binge List
- [ ] Allow a user to share their Binge List
- [ ] Allow the user to Rate movies (using something more creative than just 1-5, stars, or thumbs up)
- [ ] Use the data to make connections and recommendations through something other than genre and popularity 
- [ ] Add a Second API of some kind. Maybe there's another movie DB API out there that provides facts? 
- [ ] Update this README to more accurately reflect the entire project and link to the other parts
